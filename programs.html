      <p class="sectionText">
        Safe Space Recovery is designed to facilitate recovery from a wide variety of troubling behavior patterns. It is effective with a range of addictive and problematic behaviors and circumstances (alcohol, drugs, gambling, overeating, grief, mental health, chronic pain, etc.).

        Safe Space Recovery is based on scientific knowledge and is intended to evolve as scientific knowledge evolves.

        The Safe Space model is built on psychological tools of cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing.

        The Safe Space approach is built on the belief that freedom to recover fundamentally requires the exercise of personal choice.

        Safe Space Recovery can be used as a stand-alone primary recovery support program for those seeking help in recovery but can be used while using other means of recovery.

        Safe Space Recovery is a community of peer support groups that help people recover from addictive and problematic behaviors and circumstances, using a self-empowering and evidence-informed program.

      Safe Space Recovery facilitates recovery in a “safe space”. It is membership based only to maintain the integrity of the safe space needed to support the community we serve – individuals with environmental illness.
