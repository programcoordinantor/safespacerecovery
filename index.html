        Safe Space Recovery is a fresh approach to recovery. It is a transformative method of moving from addictive substances and negative behaviors to a life of positive self-regard and willingness to change. All is provided in an accessible “safe space”.

        Safe Space will help you learn the skills you need to overcome and transform your lives.

        Safe Space was created for people seeking a self-empowering way to overcome addictive problems. What has emerged is an accessible method of recovery, one grounded in science that uses practical tools that encourage lasting change that is provided in a safe space.

        Safe Space is a powerful recovery community that includes passionate volunteers who recovered with the program and who are driven to help others. Peers and professionals worked together to fuse science and experience to help people build healthy and balanced lives.

        In our mutual support meetings, participants design and implement their own recovery plan to create a more balanced, purposeful, fulfilling, and meaningful life. Safe Space provides specialized meetings and resources for a variety of communities, including Family & Friends, veterans, and more.

        Safe Space Recovery works. Whether an individual has chosen recovery as their path or been mandated to attend a recovery program, we provide a path to wellness.
